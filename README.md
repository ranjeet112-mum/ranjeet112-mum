# Hi there 👋, I'm Ranjit

🚀 **Tech Enthusiast | Problem Solver | Builder of Smart Systems**

I’m Ranjit — a curious mind who loves solving puzzles, digital or otherwise.  
Whether it’s **cracking code**, **streamlining systems**, or **making products work smarter**, I’m always up for a challenge.

I thrive on **curiosity**, **experimentation**, and the joy of building something meaningful.  
When I’m not deep in code, you’ll find me exploring new ideas, learning how things work, or tinkering with projects that make life a little more efficient — and a lot more fun.
